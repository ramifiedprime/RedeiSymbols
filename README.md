# RedeiSymbols

Some code which implements the computation of Redei Symbols outlined in ["On Redei's Biquadratic Artin Symbol" (Stevenhagen 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06250) in Magma.  The Tests directory contains some general testing which verifies Redei reciprocity holds inside a given cube, as well as an additional conjecture (which has since been proven).
